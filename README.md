Ideological Analysis with LSA and Custom Embedding Model

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of ideological patterns using a text corpus. The approach combines Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and a custom ideological embedding model to explore and visualize ideological distributions.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: Loads and preprocesses a text corpus.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical features.
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): Reduces dimensionality and identifies underlying topics.
Custom Ideological Embedding Model: Simulates user interactions and updates ideological embeddings based on observed and unobserved data.
Visualization: Normalizes and plots embeddings to interpret ideological positions.
Usage:
Load and Preprocess Data: Ensure your text corpus is in a file named ideological_corpus.txt.
Vectorize and Analyze: Run the provided Jupyter notebook to perform text vectorization, LSA, and ideological modeling.
Visualize Results: Explore ideological patterns through the generated visualizations.
Requirements:
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
(Pre-trained word embeddings if used)
This repository is ideal for those interested in text analysis, topic modeling, and ideological pattern recognition.
